Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

I have done research on how to obtain data from a website, like ESPN, and came up with steps I must implement once I am able to import the data I need.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I have not been able to get to the next steps after I gather the necessary data from the website because this is my first attempt at web scraping.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

I have not encountered any problems yet with my code, but I need to put in more time into the project and progress further because I am still in the process of researching and learning new techniques.
