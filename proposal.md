# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?
"Finding the Optimal Fantasy Football Lineup"

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")
Creating a program that takes data from a website and compares projected weekly scores between players on a team to provide the lineup with the highest projected outcome.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?
Essentially, this project will take in certain pieces of data from the ESPN website that pertain to my fantasy football team. The software will display the most optimal lineup on a weekly basis by comparing data and projected outcomes throughout my roster. The program will have to use many of the topics we focused on earlier in the semester such as for loops, reading data, displaying data, dictionaries, functions, if statements, and several more. The general idea of its execution is that, first, with some research on my own to learn new topics, the program will scan through and select the data that I need from the website, store that data in a dictionary, then read through the data to compare which players have the highest projected outcome for the week. It will narrow down my options and only display a starting lineup with the necessary amount of players for each position and their projected score next to their name.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?
N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.
N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?
A good outcome for my final project ultimately comes down to me learning new skills and reinforcing the ones I have learned thus far throughout the course of the semester. Even if the program is not completely finished, I hope that my program is at least capable of reading in data from a website and storing them in an organized fashion. Also, if I need to manipulate any data, my program should be able to write in any changes or additional details.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?
A better outcome for my final project includes the details mentioned in the previous question in addition to associating the data with each of the respective players on my team. Also, I would like for the program to be able to compare the data between one another to find higher and lower values.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?
The best outcome for the final project calls for the data to be stored, organized, and displayed properly. When the program runs, it should display the most ideal starting lineup (points-wise) that contains the players in the lineup in a vertical list with their respective projected points for the week next to each name.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?
Web scraping is a new skill that I will need to acquire because, without it, I will be unable to take the necessary data from the ESPN website and use it in my program. I will need to complete research on HTML code, the Python library, "Beautiful Soup", finding elements by id, as well as extraction of text and attributes from HTML elements. To start I need to look into the ESPN website and get a solid understanding of its layout/format. Afterwards, I will need to do some extra research to find out how to take the data I need from the website and parse through it in Python. From here, I will need to store the data in some way that will work consistently even when there are changes to the data each week. After this step, I will have to compare the data and certain stats between players to narrow in on the best options for the week. After the data comparison is figured out, I will focus on how the lineup and data for each player/position will be displayed on the output.
